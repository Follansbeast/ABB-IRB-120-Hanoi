# Tower of Hanoi with ABB IRB 120
Re: Chris Boden @Physicsduck


## Project Description
- Get “Topsy” / “Turvy”, two ABB IRB 120 M2004 robots working and solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.\
- The problem involves moving 10 rings from one pole to another, one at a time.\
- The smallest ring is ~¾” in diameter. 
- The largest ring is ~1 ⅞”  in diameter. 
- The rings are all ¼” thick.
- The diameter of the posts is ~¼”. 
- Post A is ~2 ⅜” from Post B on center. 
- Post B is ~3 7/16” from Post C on center.
