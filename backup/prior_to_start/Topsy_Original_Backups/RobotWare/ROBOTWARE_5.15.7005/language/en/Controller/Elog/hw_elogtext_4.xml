    <Consequences>When the SMB battery power supply is interrupted, the robot will lose the revolution counter data. This warning will also repeatedly be logged.</Consequences>
    <Causes>This may be due to an SMB battery that is discharged or not connected. For some robot models, the SMB battery power is supplied through a jumper in the robot signal cable (refer to the IRC5 Circuit Diagram), and disconnecting the cable interrupts the battery power supply. Some earlier robot versions used rechargeable batteries, and these must be charged for at least 18 hrs before working correctly. </Causes>
    <Actions>1) Make sure a charged SMB battery is connected to the board. <p />2) NOTE! Disconnecting the robot signal cable may disconnect the SMB battery power supply, triggering the battery warning to be logged. <p />3) Reset the battery power warning by updating the revolution counters as detailed in the Calibration or Product Manual. <p />4) Replace the battery if discharged.</Actions>

    <Causes>The resolver feedback may be poor or the speed loop gain may be badly adjusted.</Causes>
    <Actions>1) Check the resolver cable and the resolver grounding for this joint. If this joint is an additional axis, then check that the motor data in the configuration file is correct. How to check the configuration file is detailed in the Trouble Shooting Manual. <p />2) Reduce the gain of the speed loop.</Actions>
